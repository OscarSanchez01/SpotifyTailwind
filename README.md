# My First Project with Tailwind CSS
This is my first project using Tailwind CSS, where I have tried to emulate the Spotify page but with personal modifications, without making it an exact copy. In addition, I have added a form section with validation to improve the user experience.

*Project Features:*
- Design inspired by Spotify, but with my own changes to make it unique.
- Use of Tailwind CSS for styling and layout of the project.
- Form section with validation to verify the data entered by the user.
- Responsive interface, adapting to different screen sizes.

*Technologies Used:*
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (for form validation)

*Future Improvements:*
- Implementation of more dynamic components.
- Integration with an API for data handling.
- Improved form validation with more rules and custom messages.
